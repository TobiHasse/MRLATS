# MRLATS
Meandering River Length and Time Scales
This repository was created by Tobias Hasse (tobiack@udel.edu) to host source code related to my thesis research.

### Function and use
This code is intended to determine three characteristic emeergent parameters from the dynamics of a meandering river which are a
- Length Scale
- Velocity Scale, and
- Time Scale

The Time Scale is of particular untility because it provides an estimate of the characteristic sediment storage timescale without the intensive effort required by field work or simulations such as the simulation of github.com/TobiHasse/MRDAST
These characteristic emergent parameters are determined by simulating a suite of meandering rivers across a wide range of inputs

The code in this repository is required for the third chapter of my dissertation: Hasse, Tobias Raphael. "Storage Time Dynamics of Meandering River Floodplain Sediments: A Modeling Study." PhD diss., University of Delaware, 2021.  In that chapter I develop the theory behind the code and describe the mathematical relationships underlying it.

### Dependancies
This repository requires the following MATLAB toolboxes:
- The Curve Fitting Toolbox
This repository is a specific application of my repository
- github.com/TobiHasse/LOMR
 
A package of code files will be added to this repository at a later time. NOW COMPLETED, but the two functions for fitting the data have not been re-validated because I don't have the Matlab Curve Fitting toolbox (yet)
