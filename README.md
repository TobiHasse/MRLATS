# MRLATS
Meandering River Length and Time Scales
This repository was created by Tobias Hasse (tobiack@udel.edu) to host source code related to my thesis research.

The overall structure of this code is to run my branch of Jon Schwenk's Life Of a Meander Bend (LOMB) code to generate a suite of simulation output and determine the characteristic: 
  Length Scale, 
  Velocity Scale, and 
  Time Scale. 
The idea is to formulate a timescale of sediment storage without the intensive effort required by field work or simulations such as MRDAST

A package of code files will be added to this repository at a later time.
